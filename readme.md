# Car Price Prediction

Originally, my goal with this mini-project was going to be to explore the use of various statistical and ML models to both predict and explain car prices. 
Specifically, by using [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafarali27/car-price-prediction/data)

But after getting pretty deep into the dat-exploration, I grew much less interested in the project since it appears to be artificially created
or doctored in some way.   

See someone else's comment on the discussion board [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafarali27/car-price-prediction/discussion/539482)...

So I am dropping this project for now, but will probably come back to it in the future if I find an interesting dataset.
